### Introduction
Object Tracking pipeline leveraging YOLOv4, DeepSORT, and Tensorflow.  DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking 
with a Deep Association Metric) uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection.

### Installation
  * It is recommended to first 
  * Download model weights, place in /data directory.
  * Create a tools/splunk.py file with Splunk HEC endpoint & headers, example:
    
    splunk_ep = https://[SplunkIP]:8088/services/collector/event
    
    headers2 = {'Authorization': 'Splunk [SplunkToken]', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
  * Refer to [yolov4-deepsort](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-deepsort) repo for detailed instructions on
    pipeline implementation options.

### Usage
```
python object_tracker.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-tiny-416 --model yolov4 --video 0 --tiny --info
```
