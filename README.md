### Introduction
Object Tracking pipeline leveraging YOLOv4, DeepSORT, and Tensorflow.  DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking 
with a Deep Association Metric) uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection.  Detections,
Inference time, and FPS are sent to Splunk via HEC.  Splunk tracks detections over time, object preferences/popularity,
and displays results in near real-time.

### Installation
  * It is recommended to first create an isolated python virtual environment.  Libraries required depend on whether you 
    are using GPU or CPU, and include opencv, matplotlib, tensorflow, pillow, etc.  See requirements file for specifics.
  * Download model weights, place in /data directory.  For faster inference, it is recommended to select the
    [YOLOv4-Tiny model](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.weights).
  * Create a tools/splunk.py file with Splunk HEC endpoint & headers, example:
    
    splunk_ep = https://[SplunkIP]:8088/services/collector/event
    
    headers2 = {'Authorization': 'Splunk [SplunkToken]', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
  * Refer to [yolov4-deepsort](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-deepsort) repo for detailed instructions on
    pipeline implementation options.

### Usage
```
python object_tracker.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-tiny-416 --model yolov4 --video 0 --tiny --info
```

### Tips
  * Detections:  Try various angles/rotations of each object, adjust distance (move closer and further away) from the 
    camera.
